        <p>
          Judo is a modern Japanese martial art and sport that was developed in
          the late 19th century by Jigoro Kano. The word "Judo" translates to
          "the gentle way," emphasizing the principle of using an opponent's
          force and movements against them rather than relying on one's own
          strength. Judo practitioners, known as judoka, aim to throw or
          immobilize their opponents on the ground, or apply joint locks and
          strangles to force them to submit. Judo places a strong emphasis on
          the principles of maximum efficiency and mutual welfare. It is not
          only a physical discipline but also a mental and moral one, promoting
          respect, discipline, and the development of character. Judo is
          practiced worldwide both as a recreational activity and a competitive
          sport, with a structured system of belts to signify the practitioner's
          skill level.
